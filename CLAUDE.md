# CLAUDE.md

Rust workspace: `videoeditor` — scripted short-video renderer (markdown in,
vertical video out via headless Chrome + ffmpeg + ElevenLabs).

## Layout

- `crates/videoeditor` — CLI + scene orchestration; embeds `templates/` and
  `formats/` (extracted to `~/.cache/videoeditor/<version>/` at runtime;
  `VIDEOEDITOR_ROOT` overrides).
- `crates/videoeditor-timeline` — script.md parser → `Episode`/`Scene`/`Clip`.
- `crates/videoeditor-chrome` — CDP driver (long-lived headless Chrome; NEVER
  single-shot `--screenshot`, it hangs on macOS).
- `crates/videoeditor-media` — all ffmpeg/ffprobe invocations + assembly.
- `crates/videoeditor-voice` — ElevenLabs TTS/STT (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`).
- `examples/hello-bench` — smallest end-to-end episode; keep it rendering.

## Commands

- Nix is the preferred dependency path: `nix develop` (dev shell) /
  `nix build .#videoeditor` (the install artifact CI gates on). Keep
  `flake.lock` committed; `nix flake update` only as a deliberate PR.

- `just check` — clippy -D warnings + fmt --check (CI runs the same recipe).
- `just test` / `cargo test --workspace` — parser + fit-check tests live in
  videoeditor-timeline.
- After ANY voice or timing change: re-run tts → heed the fit-check warnings
  (`⚠ narration overlap/truncated`) → recompute scene durations → re-render.
- `cargo run -p videoeditor -- build examples/hello-bench` — end-to-end smoke
  (needs Chrome, ffmpeg, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY).

## Rules

- Scene templates are PURE functions of (data, t) — no CSS animations, no
  timers, no network. Everything derives from `SCENE.d` and `SCENE.t`.
- Templates resolve in layers: episode dir → frontmatter `packs:` →
  `$VIDEOEDITOR_PACK_PATH` → built-ins (`videoeditor pack list <ep>` shows
  provenance). Users never hand-roll templates — `pack init` scaffolds a
  pack whose `templates/CLAUDE.md` is the authoring contract; author
  templates WITH the user per that file.
- Releases go through release-plz (PRs to main; never bump versions by hand).
- Never commit media renders or API keys. Committed images go through git-lfs.
- Production craft for episode content lives in crates/videoeditor/guide.md
  (embedded; printed by `videoeditor guide`) — the single source of truth.
  Never duplicate its rules into other docs; point at the command instead.
